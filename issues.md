# Issue reporting guidelines

## General guidelines

An issue must be an actionable task or an issue used to track multiple tasks.
It must be clear at a glance what needs to be done for an issue to be resolved.

**Issue titles:**

- The title of an issue has to convey succinctly what the task is.

**Description:**
An issue's description should list what needs to be done and the status of the task or sub-tasks.
It should be clear to a reader who has no context on the issue what the current status of the task is and what is left outstanding.
The scope and status of an issue can be conveyed via a checklist or using labels.

- It should not be necessary to scroll through comments or replies to find the status of the task or sub-tasks.
- The status of the task (or sub-tasks) must be visible in the issue description or via labels.
- Updates to the status of the task should be done by editing the issue description or task list instead of in a comment replying to an issue.

### Discussions

- Comments in an issue should be limited to details or context that helps resolve the issue.
  If a discussion needs to take place to clarify an issue, or if a discussion begins, it should be moved to a GitHub discussion.
- If an issue has no clear consensus on how to resolve it, it should be moved to a discussion.
- If the requirements for completing the task expand while it's being resolved, or if the work is unclear, a discussion must be used to flesh out details for clarity.
